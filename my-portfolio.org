* About
#+begin_src markdown :tangle README.md
# Purpose

This is a toy project for learning lisp as well as maybe a little bit of devops, infrastructure, security, and other stuff.
Oh, and it's a personal website now I guess!
#+end_src

* My-Portfolio
** TODO Is it possible to separate docker-compose files by service? making them independently deployable?
   Essentially we don't want to update the compose file on the server but only deploy one service, 
   making the other running services out of date with the current compose... perhaps docker already manages this?
   Always do full deploys?
** TODO [#A] More travel photos
   - [ ] find the original dnf/yum flags used to configure image-magick 
   - [ ] build image-magick from source with heif support (./configure --with-heic=yes)
** TODO [#B] Monitoring
*** docker
*** nginx
*** lisp-app
*** email notifications
** TODO [#B] Html, js, and css minifying
** TODO [#B] dynamically load webfonts? and boostrap?
** TODO [#B] github release versions? dockerhub release versions?
** TODO [#B] Backup and rollbacks
** TODO [#C] Loading Spinner
** TODO [#C] Find better Lisp code formatter
** TODO [#C] Tree shaking
** TODO [#C] Integration Testing
   - [ ] create testable *staging* environment, probably with docker containers
   - [ ] mailgun-client
   - [ ] End to end integration testing (phantom.js?)
** TODO [#C] solidify endpoints, only allow minimum number of request-methods
*** Do this via [[https://github.com/archimag/restas][Restas]] or [[http://8arrow.org/caveman/][Caveman2]]
** TODO [#C] Create Web project template Library
** TODO [#C] Performance Profiling
** TODO Add Project scripts
   - [ ] generate nginx.conf from nginx.dev.conf
   - [ ] transfering files to server
   - [ ] server setup, (/var/{my-portfolio,nginx}, /etc/nginx/, etcetera....)
** TODO CI Server (Gitlab)
** TODO [1/3] index.txt and robots.txt and sitemaps
   - [X] robots.txt
   - [ ] html <meta> robots directive
   - [ ] http response headers x-robots-tag
** TODO [1/3] Handler logging file size growth
   - [X] use correct directory for storage
   - [ ] cleanup cronjob?
   - [ ] configure in an automated way
** TODO Improve handling of application secrets
   *Avoid creating a development environment nightmare*

   - [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/][Kubernetes Secrets]]
   - [[https://www.vaultproject.io/][Vault]]
*** At least create standard env files
** TODO log4cl
   *Is this necessary?* Perhaps only for learning purposes...
   Probably an improvement over hunchentoot's mutex stuff

** TODO spinner on submit message
** TODO minor config from [[https://gitlab.onnix.io/root/pr0nage/blob/9fa3f5d837cdd00f65e9d2c944b11b7de7e42440/init.lisp][Some Gitlab Repo]]

   - [ ] 5xx 
   - [ ] 4xx
   - [ ] maintenance pages? This might require higher level nginx stuff
     These would be backup, always available to nginx despite the portfolio webapp being unavailable (perhaps use docker volume magic with static files?)
** DONE Update nginx.conf to block more pesky hackers
   CLOSED: [2019-10-18 Fri 13:30]
   - [X] add ignore to every server block
   - [X] pull conf into it's own file, and the link everything up with docker, also keep track on server
** DONE Cleanup project configuration build directories
   CLOSED: [2019-10-18 Fri 15:07]
   - [X] directories (build, configs)
   - [X] docker-compose reference cleanup
   - [X] nginx conf reference cleanup
   - [X] makefile reference cleanup
** DONE Unit Testing [3/3]
   CLOSED: [2019-10-17 Thu 14:22]
   - [X] Setup framework (handled with (asdf:test-system), and docker)
   - [X] Unit tests
   - [X] Email Handler Tests

** DONE Don't leak server version, both nginx and hunchentoot
   CLOSED: [2019-10-13 Sun 15:48]
   - [X] hunchentoot version leaking (requires a custom acceptor)
   - [X] +hunchentoot leaks ip and port on errors+ (requires error template, see customer 4xx and 5xx pages)
